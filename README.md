# Definition

The "Ballistic" program is a simple Java application designed to calculate the vertical position of an object at a given time when it is thrown upwards from an initial position with a specified initial velocity. The calculation is based on the following physics formula:


x0 + v0 * t - g * t^2 / 2


Where:
- x0 represents the initial vertical position or height (in meters) from which the object is launched.
- v0 is the initial vertical velocity (in meters per second) of the object.
- t is the time (in seconds) at which you want to calculate the vertical position.
- g is the acceleration due to gravity, with a constant value of 9.81 m/sÂ².
